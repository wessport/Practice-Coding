# BACKGROUND INFO: FOR /F
# FOR /F processing of a text file consists of reading the file, one line of text at a time and then breaking the line up into individual items of data called 'tokens'. The DO command is
# then executed with the parameter(s) set to the token(s) found.

# By default, /F breaks up the line at each blank space " ", and any blank lines are skipped, this default parsing behavior can be changed by applying one or more of the "options"
# parameters. The option(s) must be contained within "a pair of quotes"


# To DELETE unwanted files:
# for /f %i in (files_del.txt) do del %i


# LINUX To create a new file that shows the difference between two other files use:
diff -u file1 file2 > file3

# Windows: FC file1 file2 > file3


# To copy selected files from a text file listing which files that you want:
# for /f %i in (files_to_copy.txt) do xcopy "%i" D:\Wes\Work\USDA\raw\ND\Lidar\test_copy


# To copy ASCII files from their folders to one single folder
# for /R D:\Wes\Work\USDA\raw\ND\Lidar\nd_lidar_nov11 %f in (*.asc) do copy %f D:\Wes\Work\USDA\raw\ND\Lidar\test_copy

# for each file for in directory c:\source and subdirectories /R that match pattern (\*.xml) put the file name in variable %f, then for each file do copy file copy %f to destination x:\\destination\\


# BACKGROUND INFO: FOR /R
# Explanation of FOR modifier /R Loop through files (Recurse subfolders)
# This command walks down the folder tree starting at [drive:]path, and executes the DO statement against each matching file.

# If the [drive:]path are not specified they will default to the current drive:path.

# Unlike some other variants of the FOR command you must include a wildcard (either * or ?) in the 'set' to get consistent results returned. In many cases you can work around this by adding a single character # wildcard e.g. if you are looping through multiple folders to find the exact filename myfile.txt you could instead specify myfile.t?t
